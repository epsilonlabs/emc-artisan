# Epsilon-PTC Integrity Modeler Integration

Eclipse plugins that extend Epsilon's Model Connectivity (EMC) layer with support for managing [PTC Integrity Modeler](https://www.ptc.com/model-based-systems-engineering/integrity-modeler) models using language of the Epsilon platform, to pefrorm activities such as code generation, model validation and model-to-model transformation. Installation and usage instructions are provided in the [project's wiki](https://github.com/epsilonlabs/emc-ptcim/wiki).

# Running from 64-bit Java environments
In order to run the PTC IM Epsilon driver using 64-bit Java, two PTC IM keys need to be updated in the registry. This is done by running **as administrator** this [.reg](Files/ptc64bit.reg) file.
